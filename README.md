**Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Project (SQL Server)**

**Overview**

This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a real estate dataset (Nashville Housing) for analysis using SQL Server.
The objective was to transform raw, inconsistent housing data into a structured and analysis-ready format through systematic data cleaning techniques.
Through this project, I practised data wrangling, query optimisation, and SQL-based transformation logic.

**Dataset Description**

_**The dataset (dbo.NashvilleHousing) contains housing transaction records, including:**_

- Property details (address, parcel ID, tax district, etc.)
- Sale information (price, date, legal reference)
- Ownership and location information

**Objectives**
1. Standardise data formats (especially dates)
2. Handle missing or duplicated data
3. Split complex text fields into usable components
4. Standardise categorical values
5. Remove redundant and unnecessary columns

**Tools & Technologies**
- SQL Server Management Studio 2021 (SSMS)
- T-SQL (Transact-SQL)
- SQL concepts: CTEs, String Functions, CASE, Aggregation, DML Commands

**Data Cleaning Steps**
1. Standardise Date Format
2. Populate Missing Property Addresses
3. Split Property & Owner Addresses
4. Standardise SoldAsVacant Values
5. Remove Duplicate Records
6. Drop Unused Columns
